For the first step, I broke up the code into new classes. Once I had this working, I decided that I wanted to try and create a plugin from this code so that way the code could be re-used in other projects. I also ran into some issues with my linting, so I updated the project to use the typescript version of the airbnb config.</description></item><item><title>Phaser 100 Days Of Code Challenge Day 1</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge-day-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge-day-1/</guid><description>For the first day, I decided to start simple and focus on getting the codebase setup that way I can keep my daily log and code in the same repository. Since I decided to use TypeScript for my challenge, this meant that I would need something to transpile my code so it can run in the browser, and I already had a template setup to do this. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to create a seperate code base for each example since it would be hard to maintain, and ideally I only wanted one configuration file for the whole challenge.</description></item><item><title>Phaser 100 Days Of Code Challenge</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2020 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge/</guid><description>Between work, home life, and the side projects I am working on, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been spending as much time on my game development projects as I would like. So in order to change things up, I thought it would be fun to challenge myself to coding an hour a day with the Phaser 3 framework by doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. If you are not familiar, the #100DaysOfCode is a challenge to code for one hour a day for the next 100 days and to publicly commit to the challenge by tweeting your progress each day.</description></item><item><title>Creating A Memory Game Class in TypeScript</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/creating-a-memory-game-in-typescript/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/creating-a-memory-game-in-typescript/</guid><description>Intro The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to create a simple Memory Game class in TypeScript that will contain all of the core game logic for building a simple Memory Game.

Each post will have a seperate matching GitHub Issue. Users have to be logged into GitHub to post a comment. Even though this is an ask on the users for leaving a comment or question, signing up for GitHub is easy and free.</description></item><item><title>New Year, New Goals</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/01/new-year-new-goals/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/01/new-year-new-goals/</guid><description>It has been more than a year since I have posted any content to this site, and with the new year beginning I want to remedy that.
