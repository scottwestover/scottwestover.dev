If you are not familiar with Ludum Dare it is a game jam that has been around for over 12 years.
This time around the theme was &amp;ldquo;One Room&amp;rdquo;, so my teammates and I came up with the idea that you would play as a room in a house, and you would need to fight the rest of rooms to be the best room in the house.</description></item><item><title>Ludum Dare 36 Game Entry</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/09/2016-09-05-ludum-dare-36-game-entry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/09/2016-09-05-ludum-dare-36-game-entry/</guid><description>Last weekend a few friends from work and I decided to enter Ludum Dare. Ludum Dare is one of the longest running game jams that happens every April, August, and December. It has been around for 12 years, and we finally decided to enter this time around.
It was a really interesting experience, since you have a strict deadline to make a game, and you do not receive the theme of the game jam until the jam starts.</description></item></channel></rss>
