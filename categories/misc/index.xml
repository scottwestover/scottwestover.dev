Between working a full time job, finishing up my Masters Degree, being a father, and the craziness of the past two years with Covid and isolating, it has been a very challenging and interesting time.
In order to start producing more content on a regular basis, I decided to try out a new type of content post: developer bytes.</description></item><item><title>Switching to GitHub Issues for comments</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/01/swithcing-to-github-issues-for-comments/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/01/swithcing-to-github-issues-for-comments/</guid><description>With the new year, I decided to explore new ways of handling comments on my blog. In my research, I happened to come accross Gitment . Gitment is a small JS library that leverages GitHub Issues for storing comments on each post.
Some things to note about Gitment:
Each post will have a seperate matching GitHub Issue. Users have to be logged into GitHub to post a comment. Even though this is an ask on the users for leaving a comment or question, signing up for GitHub is easy and free.</description></item><item><title>New Year, New Goals</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/01/new-year-new-goals/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2020 06:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/01/new-year-new-goals/</guid><description>It has been more than a year since I have posted any content to this site, and with the new year beginning I want to remedy that. Looking back, 2019 was quite a busy year and this blog just kept being put on the back burner. Between taking classes for my Masters Degree, the promotion at work, the side work I was doing for Zenva, GameDev Academy and Phaser GameDev Tutorials, and the time with my wonderfull family I had a little time for much else.</description></item><item><title>Site Updates</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/07/under-contruction/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jul 2018 01:24:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/07/under-contruction/</guid><description>After working with the Hugo static site generator, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I wanted to move my blog over to this template.
For the most part, this should be an easy transition since all of the blog files were already Markdown files, but with the transition, there could be some small issues.
Hopefully this will be a smooth transition, and I hope you like the new site design!</description></item><item><title>Progressive Web App</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/02/progressive-web-app/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2018 02:58:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/02/progressive-web-app/</guid><description>At the beginning of January, I was accepted into the Grow With Google Scholarship from Udacity. If you are not familar with this program, I really recommend that you check it out. Basically, Google is scholarships for the Nano degrees that are available on Udacity. However, the scholarship is split into two phases.
During the first phase, they admit 10,000 or 15,000 into the first phase (depends on which track you applied for), and you have 3 months to complete the courses that they make available to you.</description></item><item><title>Switching to Hexo</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/02/switching-to-hexo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 23:04:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/02/switching-to-hexo/</guid><description>Update: 2018-07-15 - With the new updates to the blog it is no longer a PWA. This is coming soon&amp;hellip;
It has been awhile since my last post, and with a new year, I figured it was time for a change. I started looking into new ways to blog, and I decided to give Hexo a try.
Also, with the switch to a new platform, I decided to update the look of my blog and went with a simple theme so I could just focus on the blog posts.</description></item><item><title>Troubleshooting APIs With A RESTClient</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/03/2016-03-25-troubleshooting-apis-with-restclient/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/03/2016-03-25-troubleshooting-apis-with-restclient/</guid><description>When it comes time to connect to APIs, I find that it is a lot easier to test them using a REST client before you start writing any code. Using a REST client allows for you to make sure that you are able to connect to it successfully, and it allows for you to try out different parameters of the API.
One of the best tools that I was introduced to is, the Firefox RESTClient Plugin.</description></item><item><title>Update For March</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/03/2016-03-23-update-for-march/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/03/2016-03-23-update-for-march/</guid><description>Hi Everyone,
I know it has been awhile since my last post here, so I just wanted to give everyone a quick update. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a lot of time to create content rich posts since I have had a few life changes in the past 2 months. I ended up fracturing my ankle mid February, so my daily routine has changed quite a bit, and I had been asked to create blog posts for the new support community at LivePerson, so I have been focusing on creating content there.</description></item><item><title>Free Code Camp - A Community Where You Can Learn To Code And Help Nonprofits</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/01/2016-01-11-free-code-camp-community-where-you-can/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/01/2016-01-11-free-code-camp-community-where-you-can/</guid><description>Today I wanted to share with everyone a website that I came across and that I have started using:Â http://www.freecodecamp.com/

This was my 1st year of maintaining a blog, and what a learning experience it has been.
Initially, I started this blog as a way to share what I had learned on AEM, and I was able to share a lot of information. However, with a career change, and not knowing how popular some of the posts where going to be, I had to start allocating time for comments, and time to improve general design of my blog.</description></item><item><title>Blog Redesign</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2015/10/2015-10-18-blog-redesign/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2015/10/2015-10-18-blog-redesign/</guid><description>Hi Everyone,
After much thought, I decided to update the look and feel of my blog to make it look a little more modern. I liked the old design, but it seemed a little basic. With the redesign, I decided to add two new ways to navigate the site.
The first is an archive list on the navigation bar. You can easily get between the older posts using this drop down menu.</description></item><item><title>My First Post</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2015/03/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2015/03/my-first-post/</guid><description>I just wanted to say hello to everyone, and say thank you for visiting my blog. I am new to blogging, so I am hoping to get into the swing of things, and I am able to post some content on a regular basis. I plan to post my first tutorial later today, and I hope you all find it useful.</description></item></channel></rss>
