If you are not familiar with the classic arcade game Snake, it is a game that was originally created in the 1970's, and it gained a lot of popularity when it was included on Nokia phones. The game itself has a few variants.
For this tutorial, the main objective of the game is to eat as many apples as you can without running into the any of the walls, obstacles, or yourself.</description></item><item><title>Unity Live Training Session On December 19th (Making A Flappy Bird Style Game)</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/12/unity-live-training-session-on-december/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/12/unity-live-training-session-on-december/</guid><description>Unity will be holding another live training session on December 19th, at 3:00 - 4:00 PM EST.

If you are not familiar with Ludum Dare it is a game jam that has been around for over 12 years.
This time around the theme was &amp;ldquo;One Room&amp;rdquo;, so my teammates and I came up with the idea that you would play as a room in a house, and you would need to fight the rest of rooms to be the best room in the house.</description></item><item><title>Unity Live Training Session On November 14th (Creating A Quiz Game: Session 1)</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/11/2016-11-12-unity-live-training-session-on-november/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/11/2016-11-12-unity-live-training-session-on-november/</guid><description>Unity will be holding another live training session on November 14th, at 3:00 - 4:00 PM EST.
