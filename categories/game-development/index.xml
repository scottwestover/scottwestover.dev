For this series, we will be trying to keep things as simple as possible, so we will not be using things like node, npm, webpack, vite, etc.</description></item><item><title>HTML5 Game Development - Tutorial Series Announcement</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2022/08/html5-game-development-tutorial-series-announcement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 06:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2022/08/html5-game-development-tutorial-series-announcement/</guid><description>Today, I wanted to introduce a new series that I will begin working on that will be focusing on creating games with pure JavaScript and rendered on HTML using the HTML Canvas element . This series will focus on step by step tutorials for learning the basics of working with the HTML Canvas elements for game development and then we will move on to creating games.
As we progress through the series, we will be building blocks of re-usable code that you will be able to use to create your own games.</description></item><item><title>Clicker Jam Summer 2022 Game Jam Submission - Idle Programmer</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2022/06/clicker-jam-summer-20202-game-jam-submission-idle-programmer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jun 2022 12:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2022/06/clicker-jam-summer-20202-game-jam-submission-idle-programmer/</guid><description>This week I decided to participate in the Clicker Jam Summer 2022 game jam.

For the first step, I broke up the code into new classes. Once I had this working, I decided that I wanted to try and create a plugin from this code so that way the code could be re-used in other projects. I also ran into some issues with my linting, so I updated the project to use the typescript version of the airbnb config.</description></item><item><title>Phaser 100 Days Of Code Challenge Day 1</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge-day-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge-day-1/</guid><description>For the first day, I decided to start simple and focus on getting the codebase setup that way I can keep my daily log and code in the same repository. Since I decided to use TypeScript for my challenge, this meant that I would need something to transpile my code so it can run in the browser, and I already had a template setup to do this. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to create a seperate code base for each example since it would be hard to maintain, and ideally I only wanted one configuration file for the whole challenge.</description></item><item><title>Phaser 100 Days Of Code Challenge</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2020 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge/</guid><description>Between work, home life, and the side projects I am working on, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been spending as much time on my game development projects as I would like. So in order to change things up, I thought it would be fun to challenge myself to coding an hour a day with the Phaser 3 framework by doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. If you are not familiar, the #100DaysOfCode is a challenge to code for one hour a day for the next 100 days and to publicly commit to the challenge by tweeting your progress each day.</description></item><item><title>Creating A Memory Game Class in TypeScript</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/creating-a-memory-game-in-typescript/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2020 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/creating-a-memory-game-in-typescript/</guid><description>Intro The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to create a simple Memory Game class in TypeScript that will contain all of the core game logic for building a simple Memory Game. For this tutorial, we will be testing our game logic using the browser developer console.

This template uses Webpack Dev Server , which provides live reloading while working on your game. It will also bundle all of JS files into one file once you are ready to deploy your game.
However, one thing that is missing from this template for me is support for ES6 and other newer features of JS.</description></item><item><title>Creating A Phaser 3 Template Tutorial - Part 1</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/10/creating-a-phaser-3-template-tutorial-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 21:34:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/10/creating-a-phaser-3-template-tutorial-part-1/</guid><description>My new Phaser 3 tutorial on creating a Phaser 3 template is finally live on Game Dev Academy.
