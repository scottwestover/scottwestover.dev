While waiting for the new version to be released, the developers has regularly been releasing beta builds of the framework, so it has been interesting to watch how it has changed. The API has undergone a lot of changes, and everything has been rewritten since version 2.</p><p>You can find lots of examples on the new API here:
<a href=http://labs.phaser.io/index.html target=_blank rel=noopener>http://labs.phaser.io/index.html</a></p><p>There are a variety of ways on how you can get started using Phaser 3, but my favorite is the webpack template that they made (
<a href=https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template%29 target=_blank rel=noopener>https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template)</a>
. The template will automatically grab the latest version of Phaser, and it has live reload so it is easy to test your game changes as you build it.</p><p>I have been spending more time with the latest beta, and I can&rsquo;t wait for the official version to come out in just a few days. Once it is released, I am hoping to release some more most posts on it here.</p><p>If you have any comments, please share them below.</p></div><footer class=post__footer><div class="post__tags tags clearfix"><svg class="tags__badge icon icon-tag" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M32 19c0 1-1 2-1 2L21 31s-1 1-2 1-2-1-2-1L2 16c-1-1-1.4-2-1.4-2S0 12.5.0 11V3C0 1.5.8.8.8.8S1.5.0 3 0h8c1.5.0 3 .6 3 .6S15 1 16 2l15 15s1 1 1 2zM7 10a3 3 0 100-6 3 3 0 000 6z"/></svg><ul class=tags__list><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=/tags/game-development/ rel=tag>Game Development</a></li><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=/tags/phaserjs/ rel=tag>PhaserJS</a></li></ul></div></footer></article></main><div class="authorbox clearfix"><figure class=authorbox__avatar><img alt="Scott Westover avatar" src=https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d5b6863a31baa2c531949202b1de9c82 class=avatar height=90 width=90></figure><div class=authorbox__header><span class=authorbox__name>About Scott Westover</span></div><div class=authorbox__description>Scott Westover is a Software Developer who loves coding, writing tutorials, participating in game jams, and learning about new technologies.
