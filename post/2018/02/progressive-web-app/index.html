After these 3 months are over, they will offer 1,000 of these applicants a full scholarship for the Nanodegree. You can read more about it here:
<a href=https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google target=_blank rel=noopener>https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google</a></p><p>The first course that I took as part of this program was all about offline first and what a pwa (progressive web app) is. A pwa is a regular website that can appear and behave like a traditional mobile app. When implemented correctly, the pwa will allow users to <code>install</code> or <code>add</code> your website to the home screen of their phone, like it was an app. It can also cache some of the assets of your website, that way if the user tries to visit your site when offline, they will see some content, just like in a mobile app.</p><p>You can read more about pwa here:
<a href=https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/ target=_blank rel=noopener>https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/</a></p><p>Also, you can learn more about them on Udacity here:

With Hexo, it was actually pretty easy to do. I just needed to create a manifest.json, a precache service worker, and register it. There is an excellent blog post here that details how to do this:

Instead of seeing the normal offline message of your web browser, you should still see some of the content of my blog. Also, if you visit the site on your mobile device, you should get a prompt about adding this site to your home screen!</p><p>If you have any comments, please share them below.</p></div><footer class=post__footer><div class="post__tags tags clearfix"><svg class="tags__badge icon icon-tag" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M32 19c0 1-1 2-1 2L21 31s-1 1-2 1-2-1-2-1L2 16c-1-1-1.4-2-1.4-2S0 12.5.0 11V3C0 1.5.8.8.8.8S1.5.0 3 0h8c1.5.0 3 .6 3 .6S15 1 16 2l15 15s1 1 1 2zM7 10a3 3 0 100-6 3 3 0 000 6z"/></svg><ul class=tags__list><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=/tags/misc/ rel=tag>Misc</a></li></ul></div></footer></article></main><div class="authorbox clearfix"><figure class=authorbox__avatar><img alt="Scott Westover avatar" src=https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d5b6863a31baa2c531949202b1de9c82 class=avatar height=90 width=90></figure><div class=authorbox__header><span class=authorbox__name>About Scott Westover</span></div><div class=authorbox__description>Scott Westover is a Software Developer who loves coding, writing tutorials, participating in game jams, and learning about new technologies.
