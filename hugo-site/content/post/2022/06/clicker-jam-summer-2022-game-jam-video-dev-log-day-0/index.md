This week I decided to participate in the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/clicker-jam-summer-2022" target="_blank">Clicker Jam Summer 2022</a> game jam. The goal of this game jam is to create an idle clicker game in 7 days. For this game jam I decided to share my daily updates via video dev logs.

If you are interested in checking out the game that I am making, you can see the game on Itchio here: <a href="https://galemius.itch.io/idle-programmer" target="_blank">Idle Programmer</a>.

You can watch my video dev log here on YouTub: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-jdA-817K8" target="_blank">Clicker Jam Summer 2022 - Dev Log - Day 0</a>
