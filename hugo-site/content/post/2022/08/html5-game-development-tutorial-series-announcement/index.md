desc: Introducing a new series that will be focusing on game development with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript!
draft: false
---

Today, I wanted to introduce a new series that I will begin working on that will be focusing on creating games with pure JavaScript and rendered on HTML using the [HTML Canvas element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas). This series will focus on step by step tutorials for learning the basics of working with the HTML Canvas elements for game development and then we will move on to creating games.

As we progress through the series, we will be building blocks of re-usable code that you will be able to use to create your own games. Finally, with the knowledge you gain here, you should be able to pick any JavaScript game framework and use that framework for your projects, since they just build on the basics you will be learning here.

In our first post of the series, we will focus on setting up our develop environment. Once we have that setup, we can start creating games!
