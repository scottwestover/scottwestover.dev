It has been awhile since any new content has been published to my blog, but today I am happy to announce that I have released a brand new course on learning JavaScript that you can watch for free on YouTube here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmcXe0-sfoSgHQRKVWeJuIldauc9dL4rR" target="_blank">JavaScript 101</a>

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vcmGerkHyU4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br />

Over the past year and a half, I have been working as a freelancer for Zenva (<a href="https://gamedevacademy.org/author/scottwestover2006/" target="_blank">GameDev Academy</a> and <a href="https://phasertutorials.com/author/scottwestover2006/" target="_blank">Phaser GameDev Tutorials</a>) and I had the opportunity to create some video courses for them. At first I was not sure if I would enjoy making that type of content, and I found that I really enjoyed making video tutorials. As a result, for some time I have been wanting to publish some content myself, and in addition to this, I have been wanting to start a channel on YouTube and start publishing video content there.

In this course, you will learn the following:

- coding basics with JavaScript
- JavaScript, EMCAScript, and JS Versions
- HTML Canvas and JavaScript

You can also find the code for the course on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/scottwestover/learn-javascript-course" target="_blank">Learn JavaScript Course Files</a>

I hope you enjoyed this post. Please feel free to post any questions or comments below.
