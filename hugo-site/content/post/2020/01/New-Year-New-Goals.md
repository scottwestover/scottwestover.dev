desc: New Year, New Goals
---

It has been more than a year since I have posted any content to this site, and with the new year beginning I want to remedy that. Looking back, 2019 was quite a busy year and this blog just kept being put on the back burner. Between taking classes for my Masters Degree, the promotion at work, the side work I was doing for Zenva, <a href="https://gamedevacademy.org/" target="_blank">GameDev Academy</a> and <a href="https://phasertutorials.com/" target="_blank">Phaser GameDev Tutorials</a>, and the time with my wonderfull family I had a little time for much else.

But starting today, my goal is to devote some time to this blog each week. I am hoping to release at least 1 post a week. I have some additional new year's goals, and I am hoping to share that content soon.

I wish you all have a happy new year, and if you have any comments, please share them below!
