desc: Phaser 3 tutorial on making a preloader screen
---

Recently, I took a Phaser 3 tutorial writer position at Zenva (Game Dev Academy - https://gamedevacademy.org/), and now that my first tutorial has been approved and it is finally live, I wanted to share it here.

For my first tutorial, I decided to expand on the simple preloader tutorial I wrote about in Feburary (here is a link in case you missed it: https://scottwestover.github.io/2018/02/14/Phaser3-Create-a-simple-preloader/).

In this tutorial, I show you how to make a simple preloader scene by displaying a progress bar. Then, we enhance the progress bar by adding:
 - some text that shows which file has been loaded
 - display the percentage of the loading bar
 - a simple 'loading...' message
