My new Phaser 3 tutorial on making a multiplayer game in Phaser 3 is finally live on Game Dev Academy. This is the first part of the tutorial.

In this tuorial, I show you how to create a simple multiplayer game by using NodeJS and SocketIO. I start by showing you how to setup your Node server, rendering your Phaser game, and then finally we add SocketIO to the project.

From there we start adding the logic for the game.
