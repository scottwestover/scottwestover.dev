My new Phaser 3 tutorial on making a dialog modal plugin in Phaser 3 is finally live on Game Dev Academy. This is the first part of the tutorial.

In this tuorial, we focus on the basics of creating a plugin that can be reused in all of your Phaser games. We then move on to creating our basic plugin, and then we wrap up the tutorial by getting the plugin to render our dialog window in our game.

You can chekxout the tutorial here: https://gamedevacademy.org/create-a-dialog-modal-plugin-in-phaser-3-part-1/
