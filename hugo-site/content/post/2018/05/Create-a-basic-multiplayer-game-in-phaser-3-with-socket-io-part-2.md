My new Phaser 3 tutorial on making a multiplayer game in Phaser 3 is finally live on Game Dev Academy. This is the second part of the multiplayer tutorial.

In this tuorial, we pick up were we left in part 1, and we start adding the client side logic for adding players to our game. We then move on by adding the logic for player input and finally we wrap up the game by adding some collectables for the players to collect.

You can chekxout the tutorial here: https://gamedevacademy.org/create-a-basic-multiplayer-game-in-phaser-3-with-socket-io-part-2/
