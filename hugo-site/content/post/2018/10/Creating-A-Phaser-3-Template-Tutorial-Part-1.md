My new Phaser 3 tutorial on creating a Phaser 3 template is finally live on Game Dev Academy.

In this tuorial, I show you how to create a Phaser 3 template that you will be able to extend and reuse in future Phaser 3 game you work on. In the tutorial, I show you how to:

* extend the basic Phaser 3 template
* adding a Boot scene
* adding a Preloader scene

In part 2 we will wrap up the tutorial by covering the following topics:

* adding the logic for the Title Scene
* adding the logic for the Options Scene
* adding the logic for the Credits Scene
* adding the logic for the Game Scene
