After working with the Hugo static site generator, I've decided that I wanted to move my blog over to this template.

For the most part, this should be an easy transition since all of the blog files were already Markdown files, but with
the transition, there could be some small issues.

Hopefully this will be a smooth transition, and I hope you like the new site design!
