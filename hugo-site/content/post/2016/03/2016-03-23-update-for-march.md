Hi Everyone,<br />
<br />
I know it has been awhile since my last post here, so I just wanted to give everyone a quick update. I haven't had a lot of time to create content rich posts since I have had a few life changes in the past 2 months. I ended up fracturing my ankle mid February, so my daily routine has changed quite a bit, and I had been asked to create blog posts for the new support community at LivePerson, so I have been focusing on creating content there.<br />
<br />
I plan to start sharing those post here, and to start making new content for this blog shortly. In the mean time, I appreciate all of the readers that have still been dropping by.<br />
<br />
In case you are interested, here is a link to the Experts Blog on the new support community at LivePerson:&nbsp;<a href="https://connect.liveperson.com/blogs/expert-blog"><span style="color: blue;">https://connect.liveperson.com/blogs/expert-blog</span></a><br />
