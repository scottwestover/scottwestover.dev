When it comes time to connect to APIs, I find that it is a lot easier to test them using a REST client before you start writing any code. Using a REST client allows for you to make sure that you are able to connect to it successfully, and it allows for you to try out different parameters of the API.<br />
<br />
One of the best tools that I was introduced to is, the Firefox RESTClient Plugin. This plugin is very easy to use, and it allows for you to save your request for quick reference.<br />
