Last weekend a few friends from work and I decided to enter Ludum Dare. Ludum Dare is one of the longest running game jams that happens every April, August, and December. It has been around for 12 years, and we finally decided to enter this time around.<br />

  It was a really interesting experience, since you have a strict deadline to make a game, and you do not receive the theme of the game jam until the jam starts. The theme this time around was ancient technology, so we decided to try and make a 2D platformer that was similar to the old load runner games.<br />
  <br />
  You play as a caveman, and your objective is to try and steal the other caveman's fire and get it back to your cave. You must dodge the other cavemen, until you are able to make a spear which will allow you to attack them. In the end, the game was only 2 levels long.

  The game itself was made in Phaser, all audio in the game was original, and most of the art was obtained from opengameart.org.

  Overall, it was a lot of fun, and it was nice to see this project through to completion.

  If you have an interest in game development, and if you have not had the chance to enter into a game jam, I would recommend that you do. It can be quite daunting at first, but it is really rewarding when at the end of the jam, you have something to show. It is a great learning experience since it allows for you to get feedback on your work, and you can see how other people made their games.<br />
