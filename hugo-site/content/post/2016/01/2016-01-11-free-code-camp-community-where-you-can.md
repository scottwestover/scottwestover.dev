Today I wanted to share with everyone a website that I came across and that I have started using:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/"><span style="color: blue;">http://www.freecodecamp.com/</span></a><br />
<br />
Free Code Camp is a community that provides to you hundreds of hours of coding lessons, a way to build your portfolio, and they will put you in touch with non-profit organizations that will allow you to apply your new skills.<br />
<br />
Some of the skills you can learn include:<br />
<ul>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>CSS3</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Git and GitHub</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>React.js</li>
<li>D3.js</li>
</ul>
<div>
The best part of this community, is that it is free, and you can access all of the lessons without having to sign up. However, I do recommend that you join because then you can save your progress, and you will also gain access to their online community that has over 100,000 users, which allows you to network and have people you can talk to about your code.</div>

With the coding lessons, you are able to select any lesson at any time, which means you can work on the particular skills that you are interested in learning without having to go through all of the lessons in a particular order. However, if you are new to coding, then you can definitely start with the earlier lessons and work your way up to the harder concepts.</div>

Here is an example of what their map looks like:</div>

So far, I have worked on some of the lessons in my free time over the past few weeks, and I have enjoyed the experience. If you are interested in picking up new skills, I would definitely recommend that you check out this site.</div>
