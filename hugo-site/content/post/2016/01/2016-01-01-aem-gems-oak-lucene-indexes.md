Adobe will be holding another "AEM Gem" on January 20th at 11 A.M. - 12:00 P.M. EST.<br />
<br />
This session will be a technical deep dive on Oak Lucene Indexes and how they can be used to get your queries perform better. This gem will also provide insight into how asynchronous indexing works and how it can be monitored.<br />
