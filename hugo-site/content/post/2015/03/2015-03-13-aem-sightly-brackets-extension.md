With the release of AEM 6, sightly has become the new go to language instead of using JSP. With the switch to this there has a been a new tool that was released, a sightly brackets extension. This extension offers some great features such as sightly syntax highlighting, code completion for sightly expressions, and bidirectional synchronization.<br />
<br />
What does this all mean? Well, Brackets is an open source text editor that focuses on web design, and with sightly being a HTML5 template, it is a great tool to edit it with. Here is a link if you are interested:&nbsp;<a href="http://brackets.io/" target="_blank"><span style="color: blue;">Brackets</span></a><br />
<br />
The best feature of this extension is that you can package up your code, open it in Brackets and start editing it right away. Once you are done, you just click a button and your code is automatically uploaded to your AEM instance. It works the same way if you are editing that code in crxde lite, you just click a button and your code is updated in Brackets.<br />
