In this series, we will go over how to create a reusable TypeScript class that can be used to build the game Connect Four, and in a future series we will see how we can use this library to create implementations of the Connect Four game for the CLI and the web.

Previously, in [part 3](/post/2023/01/build-a-connect-four-library-in-typescript-part-3/), we added the logic for allowing the player to place a game piece in a column, logic for validating this move, and we started adding the logic for if the game is over.

In this part of the series, we are going to work on adding in the logic for checking if a player has won by getting a Connect Four.
