Hello, my name is Scott Westover and I am a Fullstack Developer who loves coding, writing tutorials, participating in game jams, and learning about new technologies.

When I am not coding, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two kids.

Scott is looking to form connections and share his knowledge.

You can connect with me on Linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-westover-77393a97/)
