The card game involves arranging cards in a specific order based on suit and rank, and the goal is to move all the cards from the tableau (the main playing area) into a set of foundations (four piles), each starting with an Ace and building up in ascending order to a King.</description></item><item><title>Parallax Scrolling Background Tutorial in Phaser 3 Video Released</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2023/02/parallax-scrolling-background-tutorial-in-phaser-3-video-released/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 12:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2023/02/parallax-scrolling-background-tutorial-in-phaser-3-video-released/</guid><description>If you are interested in learning about Phaser 3 and how to create a simple parallax scrolling background using this framework, then you should check out my new video that I released on YouTube earlier today: Parallax Scrolling Background Tutorial in Phaser 3.

For the first step, I broke up the code into new classes. Once I had this working, I decided that I wanted to try and create a plugin from this code so that way the code could be re-used in other projects. I also ran into some issues with my linting, so I updated the project to use the typescript version of the airbnb config.</description></item><item><title>Phaser 100 Days Of Code Challenge Day 1</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge-day-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge-day-1/</guid><description>For the first day, I decided to start simple and focus on getting the codebase setup that way I can keep my daily log and code in the same repository. Since I decided to use TypeScript for my challenge, this meant that I would need something to transpile my code so it can run in the browser, and I already had a template setup to do this. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to create a seperate code base for each example since it would be hard to maintain, and ideally I only wanted one configuration file for the whole challenge.</description></item><item><title>Phaser 100 Days Of Code Challenge</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jun 2020 00:00:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2020/06/phaser-100-days-of-code-challenge/</guid><description>Between work, home life, and the side projects I am working on, I haven&amp;rsquo;t been spending as much time on my game development projects as I would like. So in order to change things up, I thought it would be fun to challenge myself to coding an hour a day with the Phaser 3 framework by doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. If you are not familiar, the #100DaysOfCode is a challenge to code for one hour a day for the next 100 days and to publicly commit to the challenge by tweeting your progress each day.</description></item><item><title>Using ES6 With Phaser 3</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/10/using-es6-with-phaser-3-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Oct 2018 22:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/10/using-es6-with-phaser-3-tutorial/</guid><description>Phaser 3 offers a fantastic Webpack project template that makes it easy to start creating games right away. This template uses Webpack Dev Server , which provides live reloading while working on your game. It will also bundle all of JS files into one file once you are ready to deploy your game.
However, one thing that is missing from this template for me is support for ES6 and other newer features of JS.</description></item><item><title>Creating A Phaser 3 Template Tutorial - Part 1</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/10/creating-a-phaser-3-template-tutorial-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 21:34:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2018/10/creating-a-phaser-3-template-tutorial-part-1/</guid><description>My new Phaser 3 tutorial on creating a Phaser 3 template is finally live on Game Dev Academy.

Phaser 3 has been in continuous development since October 2016, and it has undergone a lot of changes since then. While waiting for the new version to be released, the developers has regularly been releasing beta builds of the framework, so it has been interesting to watch how it has changed.</description></item><item><title>Ludum Dare 36 Game Entry</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/09/2016-09-05-ludum-dare-36-game-entry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2016/09/2016-09-05-ludum-dare-36-game-entry/</guid><description>Last weekend a few friends from work and I decided to enter Ludum Dare.

It was a really interesting experience, since you have a strict deadline to make a game, and you do not receive the theme of the game jam until the jam starts.</description></item></channel></rss>
