With the switch to this there has a been a new tool that was released, a sightly brackets extension. This extension offers some great features such as sightly syntax highlighting, code completion for sightly expressions, and bidirectional synchronization.
What does this all mean? Well, Brackets is an open source text editor that focuses on web design, and with sightly being a HTML5 template, it is a great tool to edit it with.</description></item><item><title>AEM Interview Questions Part 1</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2015/03/2015-03-12-aem-interview-questions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2015/03/2015-03-12-aem-interview-questions/</guid><description>When you are preparing for technical interview, it is sometimes beneficial to know what types of questions that may be asked during your interview.
