Previously, in part 3 , we added the logic for allowing the player to place a game piece in a column, logic for validating this move, and we started adding the logic for if the game is over.</description></item><item><title>Build A Connect Four Library In TypeScript - Part 3</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2023/01/build-a-connect-four-library-in-typescript-part-3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 06:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2023/01/build-a-connect-four-library-in-typescript-part-3/</guid><description>In this series, we will go over how to create a reusable TypeScript class that can be used to build the game Connect Four, and in a future series we will see how we can use this library to create implementations of the Connect Four game for the CLI and the web.
Previously, in part 2 , we added the initial game initialization logic, the ability to reset the game state, and we then learned how we could test our code using the uvu framework.</description></item><item><title>Build A Connect Four Library In TypeScript - Part 2</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2023/01/build-a-connect-four-library-in-typescript-part-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 06:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2023/01/build-a-connect-four-library-in-typescript-part-2/</guid><description>In this series, we will go over how to create a reusable TypeScript class that can be used to build the game Connect Four, and in a future series we will see how we can use this library to create implementations of the Connect Four game for the CLI and the web.
