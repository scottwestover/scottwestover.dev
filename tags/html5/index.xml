We will not be going over the basics of TypeScript, however you should be able to follow along if you are not familiar with TypeScript.</description></item><item><title>HTML5 Game Development - Project Setup</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2022/09/html5-game-development-project-setup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 06:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2022/09/html5-game-development-project-setup/</guid><description>Before we start learning about HTML5 Canvas and start writing any code, the first thing we need to do is setup a development environment that will allow us to easily edit our files, serve our static files on a local web server, and view our changes in real time as we make them.
For this series, we will be trying to keep things as simple as possible, so we will not be using things like node, npm, webpack, vite, etc.</description></item><item><title>HTML5 Game Development - Tutorial Series Announcement</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2022/08/html5-game-development-tutorial-series-announcement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 06:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2022/08/html5-game-development-tutorial-series-announcement/</guid><description>Today, I wanted to introduce a new series that I will begin working on that will be focusing on creating games with pure JavaScript and rendered on HTML using the HTML Canvas element . This series will focus on step by step tutorials for learning the basics of working with the HTML Canvas elements for game development and then we will move on to creating games.
As we progress through the series, we will be building blocks of re-usable code that you will be able to use to create your own games.</description></item><item><title>HTML5 Game Prototyping Course - Part 1</title><link>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2022/04/html5-game-prototyping-course-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 00:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scottwestover.dev/post/2022/04/html5-game-prototyping-course-part-1/</guid><description>Welcome everyone! This is the first of many posts that will cover the topic of game prototyping and we will be putting game prototyping into practice by building some basic games in HTML5 using TypeScript.
What is game prototyping? In game design, game prototyping is the process by which a game designer builds the simplest version of their game in order to test their idea and get feedback. A good prototype will convey the mechanics of the game the designer wants to build and it will allow others to test the gameplay.</description></item></channel></rss>
